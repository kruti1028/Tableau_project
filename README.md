# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
In this project, my objective is to transform complex data into visually appealing and easily understandable insights through the power of Tableau and I will design a compelling dashboard that effectively communicates key findings and supports data-driven decision-making. By selecting and creating appropriate visualizations, I will ensure that insights are conveyed accurately and comprehensively to the intended audience.

## Process

 1. Importing the TB Dataset into Tableau and establishing a connection.
 2. Reviewing and adjusting the data types as needed within Tableau.
 3. Constructing various visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
 4. Exploring the data for patterns, trends, outliers, and other noteworthy observations.
 5. Identifying significant findings and key points within the dataset.
 6. Generating new relevant questions based on the data analysis.
 7. Designing and building a comprehensive dashboard that addresses the identified 

## Results
I decided to address Option 2, question number 4: Tuberculosis Burden by Country.
The focus of my analysis was to determine: which region that has been most heavily affected by TB? 
I have ceated seven vizulization in total. 
1. A map visulization illustrating the average estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) categorized by country by region
2. A horizontal bar chart presenting the estimated incident of TB cases per 100,000 population categorized by region per an annual basis
3. A line chart providing a forecast of the estimated number of deaths from TB
4. A stacked bar chart showcasing the estimated incidence of TB (all forms) categorized by region and differentiated by the method used to derive the estimates
5. A scatter plot displaying the estimated incidence versus the estimated prevalence of TB (all forms) per 100,000 population, with a filter applied based on the region.
6. A box plot showing Estimate previlaence TB (all forms) per 100000 poopulation of each country
7. A table presenting the case detection rate as a percentage, categorized by region

## Questions and answers:
1. Which regions have the highest burden of TB in terms of estimated prevalence?
Based on the data, the regions of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific are most significantly affected by the estimated prevalence of all forms of tuberculosis (TB)

2. Is there a discernible trend in the incident rates of tuberculosis (TB) cases?
Estimated incident of TB cases per 100000 population by region per year shows incidence case downword trend in year 2007 then year 2002 and estimated incident TB cases who are HIV positive has seen a consistent upword trend since 1990.

3. What does the forecasted number of deaths from TB indicate?
The projected data indicates a downward trend in the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis (TB) in both HIV-positive and non-HIV-positive cases from 2013 to 2016.

4. Which method is most commonly used to estimate the prevalence of TB?
Imputed surveys are the primary method utilized to estimate the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) across all regions.

5. Is there any correlation between the estimated incidence and estimated prevalence of TB?
The analysis reveals a clear linear relationship between the two variables, with an R-squared value of approximately 0.87. This high R-squared value suggests that around 87% of the variation in the estimated prevalence can be explained by changes in the estimated incidence. Additionally, the p-value of 0.0001 indicates that the relationship between the estimated incidence and estimated prevalence is statistically significant. 

6. whisch country has Estimated prevalence TB(all forms) per 100000 population is higher based on each counry?
Estimated prevalence TB(all forms) per 100000 population is higher in Cambodia,Western Pacific then other countries

7. Which region(s) exhibit the lowest case detection rates?
Africa and South-East Asia have the lowest average case detection rates for tuberculosis (TB), with Africa having a case detection rate of 50.80% and South-East Asia with a case detection rate of 53.50%

## Challenges 
I feel the need to dedicate more practice to parameters and calculated fields as I haven't fully grasped their usage and implementation.
In general, I find graphs to be a bit challenging to comprehend at the moment. It is a matter of concern, but I am committed to persistently working on improving my understanding and proficiency in this area.

## Future Goals
I will experiment with advanced visualization techniques within Tableau. By incorporating treemaps, network diagrams, or interactive dashboards.
I will conduct more in-depth statistical analysis to extract valuable insights from the data. By exploring correlations, regression models, or forecasting techniques
I will dedicate time to improve the design and formatting of the visualizations. Careful attention will be given to color choices, font styles, layout, and overall visual appeal.
If I had more time, I would spend it practicing and getting more comfortable with using parameters and calculated fields. This would allow me to improve the interactive elements in my dashboard.
